                    Richard P. Feynman was born in Queens, New York, on May 11, 1918, to Jewish (although
                    non-practicing) parents. By age 15, he had mastered differential and integral calculus, and
                    frequently experimented and re-created mathematical topics such as the half-derivative before even
                    entering college. Feynman received a bachelor's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of
                    Technology in 1939, and was named Putnam Fellow that same year. He received a Ph.D. from Princeton
                    University in 1942, and in his theses applied the principle of stationery action to problems of
                    quantum mechanics, laying the groundwork for the "path integral" approach and Feynman diagrams.

                    While researching his Ph.D., Feynman married his first wife and longtime sweetheart, Arline
                    Greenbaum, who was already quite ill with tuberculosis. At Princeton, Robert W. Wilson encouraged
                    Feynman to participate in the Manhattan Project. He did so, visiting his wife in a sanitarium in
                    Albuquerque on weekends until her death in July 1945. He then immersed himself in work on the
                    project and was present at the Trinity bomb test.

                    Hans Bethe made the 24 year old Feynman a group leader in the theoretical division. Although his
                    work on the project was relatively removed from the major action, Feynman did calculate neutron
                    equations for the Los Alamos "Water Boiler," a small nuclear reactor at the desert lab, in order to
                    measure how close a particular assembly of fissile material was to becoming critical. After this
                    work, he was transferred to the Oak Ridge facility, where he aided engineers in calculating safety
                    procedures for material storage so that inadvertent criticality accidents could be avoided.

                    After the project, Feynman started working as a professor at Cornell University, and then moved to
                    Cal Tech in Pasadena, Calif., where he did much of his best work including research in quantum
                    electrodynamics, the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, and a model of weak
                    decay. Feynman's collaboration on the latter with Murray Gell-Mann was seen as seminal, as the weak
                    interaction was neatly described. He also developed Feynman diagrams, a bookkeeping device that
                    helps in conceptualizing and calculating interactions between particles in spacetime, notably the
                    interactions between electrons and their antimatter counterparts, positrons.

                    He later married Gweneth Howarth and had a son, Carl Richard, and a daughter, Michelle Catherine. In
                    1965, Feynman, along with Julian Schwinger and Shinichiro Tomonaga, shared the Nobel Prize in
                    Physics for work in quantum electrodynamics. Feynman's popular lection series was published in "The
                    Feynman Lectures," while his personal side was captured in "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" and
                    "What Do You Care What Other People Think?"

                    Feynman is also known for his work on the Space Shuttle Challenger accident investigation, shocking
                    the world by demonstrating the failure of the O-Rings. He died February 15, 1988, at the age of 69,
                    from several rare forms of cancer.
